# ES_Web3.0_DevOp_Week1
This repository is about what I did in learning Web3.0 development at week 1, April 28th 2024 - May 4th.

Web3.0 developemnt is a comprehensive endeavor and requires skills and knowledges from various pieces.
At week 1 (April 28th 2024 - May 4th), I learned the followings and built mini projects for exercising:


1. Solidity fundamentals
2. JavaScript fundamentals
3. Algorithms - recursions


I. Solidity:
1) Created a simple smart contract that users can upload data to & view data from it.
2) Uploaded the smart contract to Sepolia testnet.
3) Made real-time transcations and data storage on the testnet via the smart contract.


II. JavaScript fundamentals
1) Created a mini project that generate char pyrmaid. You can also choose to make the pyramid inverted


III. Algorithms - recursions:
1) Bouncing Spring
2) How many peaches
3) Factorial
4) Is power of two
